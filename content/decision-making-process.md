# Decision-making process in Patio

In Patio we are using [Consent](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/principle-consent.html)  decision-making by default.

In some situations, we might decide to use Consensus, Majority or Autocracy, but this needs to be communicated explicitly.  

Here is the main difference between the approaches:

-   Consent Decision Making: This approach focuses on identifying and resolving any objections to a proposed decision, aiming for an outcome that's "good enough for now" and "safe enough to try", rather than seeking total agreement.
    
-   Consensus Decision Making: In this method, all participants collaboratively develop, agree on, and are satisfied with a decision, ensuring that everyone's opinions are considered.
    
-   Majority Decision-Making: This form of decision-making follows a voting system where the choice gaining more than half of the votes becomes the selected decision.
    
-   –êutonomy Decision-Making: In this style, decisions are made by a single person or a select few without the input of others, typically reflecting the preferences or judgment of the individuals in power.
    

  

We choose consent as the most appropriate default method because it means that the decision is presented to the entire community and all have access to engaging in the decision. We don't explicitly wait for each of the community members to contribute and vote.

Consent does not insist on everyone's involvement in all decisions, but requires sufficient transparency and creating a space where the entire community can get familiar with the process that was followed to reach a decision. It promotes a culture that appreciates dissenting opinions and assigns decision-making supremacy to sound, reasoned arguments over individuals or groups. This principle distinguishes between opinions or preferences and valid objections, using the latter as a tool for learning and improvement. It aims for a decision that is good enough for the time being, considering potential improvements for the future.
