# Welcome to the Patio community! 🎉

Joining our cooperative requires alignment with specific criteria, ensuring that all members are committed to the same goals and can effectively contribute to our collective success. Here's what it takes to become part of Patio:

To be a representative from a  **Technical Cooperative Membership**  💻🤝: Being a part of Patio means joining a broader tech cooperative ecosystem. As such, you need to belong to a technical cooperative that covers services related to any part of the lifecycle of software development. This can range from initial planning and design 📝🎨, to programming and testing 👨‍💻⚙️, all the way through to maintenance and support 🛠️🔧. Our community thrives on the diverse expertise its members bring, contributing to a richer, more holistic understanding of the software development landscape.

This criterion helps us ensure that all members have a shared understanding of the technical work that many of us are involved in, and that we're all committed to the cooperative model 🔄.

Remember, Patio is all about community 🏘️, collaboration 🤲, and shared growth 🌱. We're thrilled at the possibility of your cooperative becoming a part of this journey with us. If you align with our values and meet the criteria, we'd be ecstatic to welcome you into our ever-growing community 🥳.
