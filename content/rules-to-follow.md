## Community Rules in the Patio Community 📜🧭

While our Code of Conduct provides a broad framework for acceptable behavior in the Patio community, here are some specific rules each member is expected to adhere to:

1.  **Respect Everyone's Time and Attention**  ⏰: Ensure your contributions are relevant to the topic of discussion. Avoid off-topic conversations and keep your posts concise to respect others' time.
    
2.  **Be Constructive and Positive**  👍: Critique ideas, not people. Back up your opinions with reasons and suggest alternatives if you disagree with something. Avoid using negative language and focus on how we can improve together.
    
3.  **Respect Privacy**  🤐: Do not share anyone's sensitive or personal information without their explicit consent. This includes email addresses, phone numbers, photos, etc.
    
4.  **Embrace Differences**  🌍: Our community is diverse, and that's our strength. Respect the diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and cultures of our members. Do not engage in behavior or speech that is racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.
    
5.  **Be Responsible**  🧗‍♀️: You are responsible for your actions, your words, and your decisions. Always think before you act and consider the potential impact of your actions on the community.
    
6.  **Avoid Spam and Self-Promotion**  🚫: Our community is not a space for advertising services or self-promotion. Ensure your posts contribute to the discussion and are not merely promotional.
    
7.  **No Harassment**  🙅‍♂️: Harassment of any sort will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    

Remember, these rules are in place to maintain a respectful, engaging, and inclusive community where everyone feels safe and comfortable sharing their ideas. Violation of these rules can result in corrective actions, ranging from warnings to expulsion from the community, as per our Code of Conduct.
